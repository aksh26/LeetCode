LeetCode Problem Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode Problem Repository! This repository contains solutions to various coding problems from LeetCode, organized into two main folders: sql and python. Whether you are preparing for coding interviews or just want to enhance your problem-solving skills, this repository can be a valuable resource.
Table of Contents

    SQL Problems
    Python Problems

SQL Problems
-The sql folder contains SQL-related problems that I have solved on LeetCode. Each problem is organized into its own subfolder and includes the problem statement, my solution, and any relevant comments or explanations.

How to Run SQL Solutions
-Use link in repective problem to test the code. If you want to run the SQL solutions locally, make sure you have a SQL database set up and use a client or command-line interface to execute the queries.

Python Problems
-The python folder contains Python-specific coding problems that I have solved on LeetCode. Similar to the SQL problems, each Python problem is organized into its own subfolder, including the problem statement, my solution, and explanations.

How to Run Python Solutions
-Same as SQL you can use link in that repective problem to run them online or if you want To run the Python solutions locally, make sure you have a compatible Python interpreter installed (e.g., Python 3.x). Execute the Python scripts in each problem's folder to see the results.

Contributing
-If you would like to contribute by adding more problems, improving existing solutions, or providing better explanations, feel free to submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated!

Happy coding!
